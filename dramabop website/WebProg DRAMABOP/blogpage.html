            <h1>Kimi to Sekai ga Owaru Hi ni (2021)</h1>
            <p>While waiting for the episodes of the ongoing hit Korean drama, Happiness,  <br>
                I found this drama in the recommendations on MyDramalist.</p>
                 <img src="img/b1.png" alt="">
            <p>The drama has two seasons which have been aired and I shall talk about both of them.</p>
            <h4>Cast</h4>
            <p>Ryoma Takeuchi as Hibiki Mamiya <br>

                Ayami Nakajo as Kurumi Ogasawara <br>
                
                Kasamatsu Sho as Hiro Todoroki <br>
                
                Marie Iitoyo as  Kanae Hiiragi  </p>

            <h4>Summary for season 1</h4>
            <p>Mamiya Hibiki is a brilliant young man with a true heart. He lives with his partner Ogasawara Kurumi and<br>
                works as an auto mechanic. They've been dating since they were in high school. Hibiki devises a strategy <br> 
                for proposing to Kurumi. He slides off a tunnel and becomes imprisoned on the day he plans to propose to <br>
                his sweetheart. He is able to flee four days later, but he is thrust into a new world. There are no <br>
                people outside, the traffic system is broken, and the streets are strewn with blood. <br>
                What happened to the rest of the world? Hibiki searches for Kurumi.</p>

            <h4>Views on Season 1</h4>
            <p>The first episode or so did not impress me, but the subsequent episodes became more powerful and <br>
                engaging. The writers did an excellent job of capturing the depths to which individuals descend <br>
                in their attempts to live, as well as moral difficulties, how people are valued differently in our <br>
                society due to variables they cannot control, and how big groups of people may be easily influenced.

            <p>To be honest, the zombies weren't the most terrifying aspect of the story; the other survivors were. <br>
                Initially, the drama never failed to deliver on the thrills, tensions, and horror that it promised.

            </div>

            <p>The second half of the drama lost its charm a bit as the focus shifted to the romance aspect and <br>
                not in the way I was hoping.But it was still entertaining to watch

             </p>

             <h4>Summary for season 2</h4>

             <p>As a new community "House of Hope" has appeared. Who are they with a prosperous civilization? <br>
                In addition, a golem with an "x" that seems to have been artificially attached appears. <br>
                A new threat comes to those who survive the "End-of-world".</p>

            <h4>Views on season 2</h4>
            <p>In this season, our hero lost quite a bit of his charm and was not even there for two entire episodes. 
                Kurumi really pissed me off this season but with reason.
            </p>

            <p>The true show stealers were Kanae and Todoroki who have grown into much better individuals during this <br>
                time of peril. They are still flawed characters but they try their best to survive. I truly hope the <br>
                upcoming season 3 gives these two more screentime and gives us more of their story.

            <p>Season 2 just had 6 episodes, which I am actually glad about since the plot <br>
                kind of spiraled downward but it left me wanting another season for sure.</p>
